# Med-MUHAS-LLM
Bilingual (Swahili-English) Medical Language Model built for education and Clinical decision Support.

The project is developed by **marcoharuni** as a public-interest AI initiative,
with a strong focus on safety, ethics, and local healthcare context.

---

## Why Med-MUHAS-LLM?

Most existing medical AI systems:
- Do not understand **Swahili medical language**
- Are trained on **non-African clinical contexts**
- Are inaccessible to local students and healthcare workers

Med-MUHAS-LLM aims to bridge this gap by providing a locally relevant,
language-inclusive medical AI system.

---

## Intended Users

- Medical students
- Clinicians and nurses
- Community health workers
- Healthcare educators

Med-MUHAS-LLM is **not** intended to replace medical professionals.

---

## Use Cases

- Medical education and exam preparation
- Explanation of diseases and treatments in Swahili and English
- Clinical reasoning support (educational, non-diagnostic)
- Patient education (simplified explanations)

---

## Safety & Ethics

- Med-MUHAS-LLM does **not** provide diagnoses or emergency decisions
- All outputs are for **educational and decision-support purposes only**
- The system follows a **clinician-in-the-loop** philosophy
- Data privacy and responsible AI principles are strictly followed

---

## Project Status

**Early Development / Research Phase**

Current focus:
- Defining scope and medical domains
- Curating open and ethical medical datasets
- Designing model architecture and safety mechanisms

---

## Roadmap (High Level)

1. Dataset collection and preprocessing (Swahili & English)
2. Tokenizer training
3. Medical domain pretraining
4. Instruction fine-tuning
5. Evaluation and safety testing
6. MVP deployment (API + web interface)
7. Pilot use in academic and clinical settings
